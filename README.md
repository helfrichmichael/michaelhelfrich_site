# MichaelHelfrich.com's Code Base

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Background

This website was a full Angular adaptation of my original college website that was built in WordPress. Over the years, 
I've become less and less thrilled with maintaining the website and additionally the security risks it has with a 
database, etc (the internet is a dangerous place). 

## Plans

My hope is to maintain this simple Angular application, a blog (at some point), and share my latest work on this site.

## Automation currently

Currently, I have Cloudflare Pages building, deploying, and serving the content on every push to GitHub for www.michaelhelfrich.com.
So far, this process has been incredibly effective and efficient. Read more on that
