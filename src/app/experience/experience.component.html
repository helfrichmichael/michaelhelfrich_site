                        I operated and maintained the company up until August 2014 when I sold the business. HostHoarders 
                        utilized OpenVZ and cPanel to offer VPS/Web hosting. Most of our systems ran on CentOS 6 and utilize 
                        virtualization technology to ensure stability and scalability. With several years of experience in the 
                        field, I began this company with the idea of offering a service at a fair and affordable price. Within 2 
                        years, I was able to develop a large client base with hundreds of clients all over the world.
