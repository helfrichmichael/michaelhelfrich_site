                        Shoutcast is one of the most popular options for internet radio broadcasting. Developed years ago by Nullsoft, the project still lives on 
                        as a standard in Internet Radio Broadcasting. I developed this administration panel in a few days using PHP. It runs on the CodeIgniter Framework 
                        and also utilizes phpseclib. It works with the transcoder and each individual server regardless of it's a relay or broadcast point.

                        SHRTN was developed while taking a PHP development class at FSU. It was designed to be a very 
                        easy-to-use and simple URL Shortener developed completely in PHP. It made use of the CodeIgniter 
                        Framework and utilized Bootstrap Styling. The project is no longer active as of January 2014,
                        but it was a great learning experience.

                        In August 2014, I started my DIS (Directed Independent Study) on Raspberry Pi's. The primary
                        purpose of this DIS was to show the uses of Raspberry Pi's and how they can be used for a 
                        ton of different projects/solutions. The project focuses on short videos that give an in-depth 
                        tutorial to doing certain projects.

                        In January 2012, I started my web hosting company, HostHoarders. The intended plan originally
                        was to provide affordable and maintained web hosting in the Tampa and Tallahassee area. Eventually 
                        I started to realize the demand for budget shared hosting across the world. I quickly joined the 
                        market and started offering extremely affordable shared hosting. These plans quickly sold and I 
                        saw a positive impact from my efforts. I was the only employee and I was managing 300+ clients. 
                        There were automated systems in place, but there was still some manual labor required. In August 
                        2014, I decided to sell HostHoarders to make time for school and future employment and career options. 
                        It was a great experience and I learned so much throughout the whole process. Skills such as systems 
                        administration, customer service, and advertising were all used throughout my time running HostHoarders.
